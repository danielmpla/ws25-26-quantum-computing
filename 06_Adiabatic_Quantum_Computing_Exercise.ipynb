    "When we talk about quantum computing, we actually talk about several different paradigms. The most common one is gate-model quantum computing, in the vein we discussed in the previous notebook. In this case, gates are applied on qubit registers to perform arbitrary transformations of quantum states made up of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most common paradigm is quantum annealing. This paradigm is often also referred to as adiabatic quantum computing, although there are subtle differences. Quantum annealing solves a more specific problem -- universality is not a requirement -- which makes it an easier, albeit still difficult engineering challenge to scale it up. The technology is up to 2000 superconducting qubits in 2018, compared to the less than 100 qubits on gate-model quantum computers. D-Wave Systems has been building superconducting quantum annealers for over a decade and this company holds the record for the number of qubits -- 2048. More recently, an IARPA project was launched to build novel superconducting quantum annealers. A quantum optics implementation was also made available by QNNcloud that implements a coherent Ising model. Its restrictions are different from superconducting architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gate-model quantum computing is conceptually easier to understand: it is the generalization of digital computing. Instead of deterministic logical operations of bit strings, we have deterministic transformations of (quantum) probability distributions over bit strings. Quantum annealing requires some understanding of physics, which is why we introduced classical and quantum many-body physics in a previous notebook. Over the last few years, quantum annealing inspired gate-model algorithms that work on current and near-term quantum computers (see the notebook on variational circuits). So in this sense, it is worth developing an understanding of the underlying physics model and how quantum annealing works, even if you are only interested in gate-model quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is a plethora of quantum computing languages, frameworks, and libraries for the gate-model, quantum annealing is less well-established. D-Wave Systems offers an open source suite called Ocean. A vendor-independent solution is XACC, an extensible compilation framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing architectures, but the only quantum annealer it maps to is that of D-Wave Systems. Since XACC is a much larger initiative that extends beyond annealing, we choose a few much simpler packages from Ocean to illustrate the core concepts of this paradigm. However, before diving into the details of quantum annealing, it is worth taking a slight detour to connect the unitary evolution we discussed in a closed system and in the gate-model paradigm and the Hamiltonian describing a quantum many-body system. We also briefly discuss the adiabatic theorem, which provides the foundation why quantum annealing would work at all."

This is a valid unitary, so we are looking for a time-independent Hamiltonian such that $S = \\exp(-i Ht/\\hbar)$. The $S$ gate is diagonal, so will be our Hamiltonian. That makes matrix exponentiation easy. So we are looking for a Hamiltonian $H=\\begin{bmatrix}h_1 & 0\\\\0 & h_2\\end{bmatrix}$ for some values $h_1$ and $h_2$.\n",
